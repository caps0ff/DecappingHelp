Caps0ff runs projects to help preserve vintage aracade and computing hardware.
Our speciality is invasive analysis such as photographing a microprocessor ROM to read out firmware.
This project is a list of things we could use help with. Please reach out if interested via GitHub or Twitter

PLEASE do not make requests here (ex: can you please work on X).
We had to close Twitter DMs shortly after creation due to a flood of such messages.

Do you run a related project and would like to coordinate here?
It was really intended for us, but we'd be open to others posting projects here if appropriate.

Thanks for your support!
